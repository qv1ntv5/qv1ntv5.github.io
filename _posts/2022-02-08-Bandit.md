# Bandit0

In this first level of bandit, bandit0, we have de goal of login in the bandit server through ssh. To achieve this goal we have the following tools: 

 - HOST: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
 -  PORT: 2220
 -  USERNAME: bandit0
 -  PASSWORD: bandit0
	
	

SOLUTION:

Atending to the sintaxis of the ssh comand, to connect to a server since a client we have to introduce the following statement on the terminal:

```bash
	ssh [username]@[hostname] -p [port]
```


Namely, in this case;

```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
	
Then, the password is required and we are in, and that's it.

< br />

# Bandit1

In bandit1, the level after bandit0, we have to acquire certain password locate in the home directory. 

First of all, when we get acces to the level1, we appear at other machine, named bandit, in the home directory. 

```bash
	bandit0@bandit:~$
```

Then all we have to do is use the 'ls' comand to see what we have in the home directory and realize that the readme text file is in this directory. 
```bash
	bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
	readme
```

Then, we have to use the 'cat' comand, that prints on the screen the content of a text file passed like an argument to cat, to see the mentioned password in the statement of the exercise.

```bash
	bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
	readme
	
	bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
	boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
	
```

Then, all that remains is to use the ssh comand in the same way we used in bandit0 to acces to other manchine and complete the exercise.

<br />

# Bandit2  

In this exercise, as same as in the other, we have to locate another password to get through the next level, bandit3, but in this case, there is an issue. 

The file which contains the password is called '-'. This is a dashed filename, is invalid for you to pass this name to any command ass an argument because the '-' token is used to get input/output from a device. Then, we have to introduce the complete path to 'cat' for succed our goal.

```bash
	bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ~/-
	CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
```

And there will be our password. We remember that, this ~/ is equal to /home/[username]

<br />

# Bandit3

In this, we have the same problem but in this case, the file's name have spaces. 

Then, at this point all shall we know that we can't pass as an argument a name with spaces directly because GNU will think that we are passing to many arguments. Then, the solution is to add an inclined bar ' \ '  between the gaps of the name like:

```bash
	bandit2@bandit:~$ cat this\ name\ have\ spaces
	UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```

or to use the 'tab' key and linux will pass the name in a valid form for you.

<br />

# Bandit4

He, all over again, we have to found a password that is alocated in a hidden file. To see that file we have to add and option to the 'ls' comand:

```bash
	bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere && ls -a
	. .. .hidden
```

And then , when we know the name of the file, only remains to pass it to 'cat' as an argument:

```bash
	bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat .hidden
	pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
```

All the name's files which start by a dot all hidden to a naked eye.

<br />

# Bandit5

In this exercise, we have other class of issue. We have many files but we are looking for the one which is human-readable between a bunch of files that aren't. 

```bash
	bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere && ls
	-file01 -file02 -file03 -file04 -file05 -file06 -file07 -file08 -file09
	
```

For pass this test, we going to use the 'file' comand and the ./ token to find out what type of data are in each file. Then the coman to use is:
	
	
```bash
	bandit4@bandit~: cd inhere && ls
	-file01 -file02 -file03 -file04 -file05 -file06 -file07 -file08 -file09
	
	bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$: file ./-file*
	
	./-file00: data
	./-file01: data
	./-file02: data
	./-file03: data
	./-file04: data
	./-file05: data
	./-file06: data
	./-file07: ASCII text
	./-file08: data
	./-file09: data
	
```

This will explore all the files as a executable files and will tell us what each file contains. The answer is that the file07 have the password because is the file which contains ascii text, readble by humans, that is: 

```bash
	bandit4@bandit~: cd inhere && ls
	-file01 -file02 -file03 -file04 -file05 -file06 -file07 -file08 -file09
	
	bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$: file ./-file*
	
	./-file00: data
	./-file01: data
	./-file02: data
	./-file03: data
	./-file04: data
	./-file05: data
	./-file06: data
	./-file07: ASCII text
	./-file08: data
	./-file09: data
	
	bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07
	koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh
	
```

<br />

# Bandit6

In this exercise, we want to find a file situated somewhere in the directory in here whose have the following conditions:

- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable

We'll follow the following secuence:

1. Locate the 1033 size files in inhere.
	````bash
	bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find ~/inhere -size 1033c
	/home/bandit5/inhere/maybehere07/.file2
	````

	There's only one and here we can presumably terminate the exercise for obvius reason but, we'll ensure that the file met the rest of the conditions.

2. Lock if the file is human-readble. For that goal, we can use the file comand:

	````bash
	bandit5@bandit:~$ file /home/bandit5/inhere/maybehere07/.file2
	
	/home/bandit5/inhere/maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines
	````
	
	and, indeed, we see that the file contains ASCII text.
	
3. Last, throught listing all files in a long list of the directory maybehere07 we find that this file is not executable, thes is our file and the password is:

	```bash
	bandit5@bandit:~$ cat /home/bandit5/inhere/maybehere07/.file2
	
	DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
	```
	
<br />
	
# Bandit7

In this exercise again we have a file hidden in somewhere in the server. 

This file, which contains the password, meet the following conditions:

- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- size 33 bytes

At first, we have to notice that in the home directory is anything. We must retrive to the / directory.

In the / directory, we have to locate our file. For that goal we can use the find comand using the corresponding flags to filter the non interesting data.

````bash
bandit6@bandit:/$ find -group bandit6 -user bandit7 -size 33c

````


But, we have a lot of garbage preventing us to locate the file we want. 

All the garbage have something related with Permission Denied. This is an error that can be handled redirecting the stderr. 

Then, the comand we want is:

````bash
bandit6@bandit:/$ find -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null

./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
````

We have redirect the stderr with 2 \> /dev/null preventing the error get printed in the screen

There is only one file, and the password is:

````bash
bandit6@bandit:/$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
````

<br />

# Bandit8
In this case, the password is situaded next to the word "millionth" in the file data.txt.

To solve this problem we can take advantage of one of the features of grep which printf the entire line of the pattern requested.

````bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth data.txt 

millionth cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

````

<br />

# Bandit9
In this exercise the password is stored in the file data.txt, is the only line that appears only once.

For this, we can first sort the lines of the file with sort command making sure that the repeat lines will appear together and then eliminating the repeated with each original line only remaining the password. All of this can be done with the command:

````bash
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR

````

<br />

# Bandit10

In this problem, we've the password storaged somewhere in data.txt, that only have a few parts of human-readable data.

We can use the string command to see the human-readble data of data.txt and the fact that our password is located after several = characters to use the output of the last comand with grep, then the comand is:

````bash
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep ======= 

========== the*2i"4
========== password
Z)========== is
&========== truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk
````

<br />

# Bandit11

In this exercise, we have our password in a encode data file in base64. All we hve to do is to decode with base64 -d comand and the password is:

````bash
bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 -d data.txt 
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

````

<br />

# Bandit12

In this case, the password has been encrypted in a ROT13 way in the data.txt file. It has to be unencrypted.

We can use the tr comand, that allow us to change characters from a file knowing how the ROT13 encryting style works, rotating 13 position the position of a caracter in the alphabet.

Then, the comand is:

````bash
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr a-z nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm | tr A-Z NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM
The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu 
````

<br />

# Bandit13

In this exercise, we have a data.txt file which is a hexdump of a file that has been already compressed.  (A HEXDUMP is a hexadecimal view of comupter data). Then, all we have to do is to first, translate the hex data to human-readable.

Because this server has certains security features, we dont will be able to create a file or a directory in any other directory than **tmp** (**t**e**mp**oral, because al the things writed in the tmp directory are erased). Then we have to cp the file to tmp and in there we use the xxd comand that allow us to create an hexdump from a file or do the reverse.

````bash
bandit12@bandit:~$ cp data.txt /tmp/data && cd /tmp && xxd -r data

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/data$ ls
data1  data5.bin  data7  data9  data.txt
````

Then with the file comand we will be allow to see what is in the data directory and we will see that the data9 file has ascii text and the password
````bash
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/data$ file ./d*

./data1:     POSIX tar archive (GNU)
./data5.bin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
./data7:     POSIX tar archive (GNU)
./data9:     ASCII text
./data.txt:  ASCII text

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/data$ cat data9
The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
````
