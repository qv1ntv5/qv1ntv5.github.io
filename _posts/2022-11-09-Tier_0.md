### 1. Mongod (MongoDB).

At first, we have a machine that is hosting two services, SSH and Mongodb:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105224518.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

MongoDB is a NoSQL database writed in C++ that listen by default on 27017/tcp. Is a non-relational document database that *provides support for JSON-like storage*.

We can interact with this service through a 'cli program' called [mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v5.0/reference/mongo-shell/, available since the APT:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105225022.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

We connect to the MongoDB through kali:

```bash
mongo --host 10.129.112.234
```

Then, we try to see all the databases:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105225605.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

and exploring the database we found a flag and employ the following command to retreive the flag:

```mongo
db.flag.find().pretty()
```

<br />

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105230424.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

<br />

### 2. Redeemer (Redis).

In this case we have a machine with the port 6379 open hosting a Redis service on "Redis key-value store 5.0.7" server:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105191944.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

*Redis* is the acronym of *Remote DIctionary Server* and is a NoSQL databse identified as a *Key-value* type (Every single item is stored as a Key-value pair, is the most simple among NoSQL Databases). Also, is a In-memory data structure store (RAM instead of disk data store which is more fast that the traditional database). By default, Redis is a service listening on 6379/tcp.

We can use a comand-line interface to interact with Redis through a terminal program called [redis-cli](https://redis.io/docs/manual/cli/) available since the APT

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105195023.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

Thus, we connect to the Redis server over the machine with the '-h' flag:

```bash
redis-cli -h 10.129.170.222
```

<br />

Once there, we can use the command 'info' to gain information about the version of the server among other things:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105195959.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

The databases on a Redis server are stored with an index. We select a database with 'select \<index>'. Once we have select an index, we can retrieve the items holded in the database by the command 'keys \*'. (We remember that the items on Redis are stored as keys values):

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105200625.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

And, last, we get the content of an item by 'Get \<keyname>':

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221105200725.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

<br />

### 3. Synced (Rsync).

We have a rsync service on default port, 873.

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221110231715.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

*rsync*Â is a fast and versatile command-line utility for synchronizing files and directories between two locations over a remote shell, or from/to a remote Rsync daemon. It provides fast incremental file transfer by transferring only the differences between the source and the destination.

The Rsync actues like a Windows SMB share, we can use the cli-tool *rsync* to connect to the remote server without autentication and retreive the flag:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/HTB/Pasted image 20221110233819.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

Thus, we know where our flag is, so we gonna transfer it to our machine:
