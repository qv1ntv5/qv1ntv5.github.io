### 1. Constants.

#### 1.1. Definition.

A **constant** in C is nothing than a name that refers to location in memory whose value cannot be modify when is declared (in contrast with a variable). The use of constant have several benefits:

- Immutability, which prevents for some accidental errors changing critical data.
- Readability.
- Consistency.

Is in summary a good programming practice to implement constants in the code. Is prefereable to use constants to reer to a value which may be error-prone if you hardcode it.

#### 1.2. Defining a constant.

There are two wways to defining a constant in C:

- Using the **const** keyword.
- Using the **#define** directive.
<br>

##### 1.2.1. Const keyword.

The sintax to define a constant using the keyword is:

```c
const type NAME = VALUE;
```

for example;

```c
const float PI = 3.1415...
```

In this context, if we try to assign a value to *PI*, we would trigger an error.

Despite the constants are made to be

##### 1.2.2. Define directive.

Other method to define a constant is to use **#define**, this is a preprocessor directive (a directive that the processor process before the code is compiled which influence how the source code is compiled).  

We can define a constant like the following line:

```c
#define PI = 3.1415...
```

And we can invoke the value by using the word in the code like as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define LENGTH 10   
#define WIDTH  5
#define NEWLINE '\n'

int main() {
   int area;  
   area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
   printf("length: %d width: %d", LENGTH, WIDTH);
   printf("%c", NEWLINE);
   printf("value of area : %d", area);
   return 0;
}
```
<br>

### 2. Literals.

The term **literal** refers to a textual representation of a value being assignated to a variable.

```c
int x = 10;
```

Instead of, for example, to initiate a variable through and expresion:

```c
int x = 10; //10 is an integer literal being asigned to a variable.
int y = 2*x; // y is being define through 'x' and is not a literal.
```
<br>

### 3. Escape Sequence.

A **Escape Sequence** in C is a literal made up of more than one character put inside single quotes (note the difference between a escape sequence and a string, which is more than one character between *double quotes*), usually, in order to difference from strings, escape sequences go after a backslash '\\':

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/C/Pasted image 20241208181911.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

For example;

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
int main(){ 
	printf("Hello.\nGood morning.\nMy name is Ravi"); 
}
```
<br>
### 4. Format Specifiers in C.

#### 4.1. Format Specifiers for Data in C.

Format specifiers in C are certain symbols used in the formatted console IO functions such *printf()* and *scanf()*. There are many types of format specifiers:

<div style="text-align:center">
	<img src="{{ 'assets/img/C/Pasted image 20241210180850.png' | relative_url }}" text-align="center"/>
</div>

And there are used as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h> 
int main(){ 
	int num = 20; 
	printf("Signed integer: %d\n", num); 
	printf("Unsigned integer: %i\n", num); 
	printf("Long integer: %ld\n", num); 
	printf("Octal integer: %o\n", num); 
	printf("Hexadecimal integer: %x\n", num); 
	return 0; 
}

//OUPUT:
//Signed integer: 20
//Unsigned integer: 20
//Long integer: 20
//Octal integer: 24
//Hexadecimal integer: 14
```
